Chapter 2
Â·Introduced Tactic: rw (rewrite)
    To replace the LHS indentity with the RHS goal.
    i.e. rw [<theorem> <objects s.t. the theorem applies to>] -- This applies the theorem from LHS to RHS.
         rw [\l <theorem> <objects s.t. the theorem applies to>] -- '\l' forms a left arrow. This applies the theorem from RHS to LHS.
    Lean4 is very specific about the theorems and the objects that the theorem applies to.
    If the objects are unspecified or partially specified in the code,
    Lean4 will look for the correct pattern from left to right and apply the theorem to the first pattern it finds.
    Moreover, Lean4 always interprets a * b * c as (a * b) * c as a default setting. Be careful when using associativity theorems.
    Throughout the proof, if Lean4 did not raise any error in the process and the goal is accomplished, then the proof is believed to be correct.
