·Introduced Tactic: rfl (reflexivity)
    Forcing Lean to recognise that the expressions on both LHS and RHS are equivalent.
·Introduced Tactic: norm_num (normal number arithmetic)
    Automatically calculating and recognising the result of number arithmetics as part of the proof.
·Introduced Tactic: group
    Automatically prove any trivial result that follows purely from the non-commutative, multiplicative group axioms.
·Introduced Tactic: abel
    Automatically prove any trivial result that follows purely from the abelian additive group axioms.
·Introduced Tactic: noncomm_ring
    Automatically prove any trivial result that follows purely from the non-commutative ring axioms.
    Notice that type Ring follows tactic 'noncomm_ring', and type CommRing follows the tactic 'ring'.
