Â·Introduced Tactic: trans (transitivity)
    Suggesting a intermediate term for applying transitivity of some ordering.
    i.e. example : (h : x < y) (h' : y < z) x < z := by
           trans y -- Suggests y to bridge the chasm of x < z, requires x < y and y < z as pre-requisites.
           apply h
           apply h' -- Provides the pre-requisites.
