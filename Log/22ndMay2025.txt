Chapter 3
·Reviewed Tactic: intro
    To introduce arbitrary variables or pre-requisites of a proposition.
    i.e. example \forall a b : \N, a = b -> b = a := by
           intro a b h -- Introduce variables a, b and the pre-requisite, h.
           exact Eq.symm h -- h is treated like a given hypothesis.
    In this case h is treated as assuming the pre-requisite is true and prove that the pre-requisite implies the goal.
    Thus the implication is proved to be true.
·Introduced Property: Monotone
    To indicate that a function is non-decreasing.
    i.e. example (f : \R -> \R) (h : Monotone f) : \forall {a, b}, a <= b -> f a <= f b := @h
There are many other properties that can be stated right before an object.

Using Proof Term Instead of Tactics
    Writing proofs in Lean is essentially constructing a term that matches the type of the goal. If the goal is a proposition of certain variables,
    then it is also a Lean function of those variables. Such functions take arbitrary values and hypothesis as inputs, and give the implied statement as the output.
    Alas, if we construct an appropriate function directly with every step specified, this function-statement will automatically accomplish the goal.
    Thus, we can write proofs in a more concise manner, i.e.
    example (mf : Monotone f) (mg : Monotone g) : Monotone fun x ↦ f x + g x :=
      fun a b aleb ↦ add_le_add (mf aleb) (mg aleb)
    'fun a b aleb' means that we are constructing a function that takes in arbitrary values a and b, and a hypothesis a <= b.
    The arrow means that we are processing the inputs as such:
    step 1 - apply add_le_add as if we are using the 'apply' tactic
    step 2 - apply mf given aleb to provide one of the pre-requisites
    step 3 - apply mg given aleb to provide the other pre-requisite
    The output of our constructed function will agree with the goal statement.
    And of course, the construction of 'helper function' can be used together with most of the techniques in Lean.

·Introduced Tactic: use
    To suggest an example or a counter-example to prove or disprove the proposition.
    i.e. use <some example>

Destructing Arguments
·Introduced Tactic: rcases
    To extract the variable and its property from a statement with existential quantifier.
    i.e. example (h: \exist x, P x) : True := by -- P is some property of x
           rcases h with \<x, Px\>
           trivial
    Activating this tactic adds a variable, x, and a hypothesis, Px, saying that x has property P.
·Introduced Tactic: rintro
    The combination of intro and rcases.
    It allows us to introduce variables & hypothesis, and matches their patterns with the original statement at the same time.
·Introduced Tactic: obtain
    Another way of forming relevant variables and hypothesis from a given proposition.
    i.e. obtain \<x, Px\> := h -- Continued from the previous cases.
